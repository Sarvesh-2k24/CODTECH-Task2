## Overview of the Project

### project: NLP APPLICATION

### Objective 
The objective is to analyze and process text data using NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to enhance text understanding and representation.

### Key activities
1)**Text Preprocessing:** Perform tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.

2)**Feature Extraction:** Implement word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe for vector representation.

3)**Model Development & Evaluation:** Train NLP models, analyze results, and visualize insights.

### Key points
1)**Python Libraries:** NLTK, SpaCy, and Transformers for NLP tasks

2)**Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.

3)**NLP Models:** Word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, and transformer-based models.



### Key Insights
By applying advanced NLP techniques, text data was effectively processed and analyzed. Word embeddings improved context understanding, while preprocessing steps enhanced model accuracy. These insights enable better sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and automated text classification for real-world applications.
